Differences between Liferay Developer Studio and Liferay IDE

Liferay IDE is the free and open source version of Liferay's developer tools
for developing with Liferay Portal Community Edition.  For Liferay Portal
Enterprise Edition customers, we have developers Liferay Developer Studio
which is a super-set of the features in Liferay IDE (since it includes a copy)
but also includes additional features specific to Enterprise Edition customers.
